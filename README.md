## How it Works

The code consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the trading robot's operation. Here is a breakdown of each function:

1. `CalculateLotSize`: This function calculates the lot size based on the user-defined parameters, including the account balance, risk percentage, and stop loss points.

2. `HasOpenPositions`: This function checks if there are any open positions in the trading account.

3. `CloseAllPositions`: This function closes all open positions in the trading account.

4. `ExecuteTrade`: This function handles the execution of buy or sell orders, setting the appropriate stop loss and take profit levels.

5. `TradeLogic`: This function implements the trading logic, checking for potential trading opportunities based on user-defined conditions and executing the corresponding trade.

6. `ExitStrategy`: This function handles trade exit strategies, including trailing stops and time-based exit conditions.

7. `HandleErrors`: This function handles errors and exceptions that may occur during trading operations.

8. `OnTick`: This function is called on every tick and serves as the main entry point for the trading robot. It calls the `TradeLogic`, `ExitStrategy`, and `HandleErrors` functions.

9. `OnInit`: This function is called when the trading robot is initialized. It sets the magic number for the trades.

10. `OnDeinit`: This function is called when the trading robot is deinitialized. It closes all open positions.
